# Model Modification Pathways in NeuroScope

NeuroScope enables several approaches to apply interpretability insights for model modification, representing a shift from "training models to behave differently" to "understanding models well enough to modify them precisely" - a much more principled and controllable approach to model modification.

## Model Modification Pathways in NeuroScope

NeuroScope enables several approaches to apply interpretability insights for model modification:

### 1. Circuit-Based Weight Editing

Once NeuroScope identifies specific computational circuits, you can directly modify the weights that implement those circuits:

```smalltalk
"Identify and modify a specific circuit"
model := TransformerModel fromHuggingFace: 'gpt2-medium'.
circuitFinder := CircuitFinder for: model.

"Discover circuit responsible for gender bias in pronoun resolution"
biasCircuit := circuitFinder 
    findCircuit: 'gender_pronoun_bias'
    examples: Dataset loadGenderBiasExamples.

"Extract the specific weights involved in this circuit"
circuitWeights := biasCircuit extractWeights.

"Apply debiasing transformation"
debiasTransform := WeightTransform 
    removeGenderBias: circuitWeights
    preservingCapability: #pronounResolution.

"Modify the model weights"
model applyWeightTransform: debiasTransform to: biasCircuit.

"Validate the modification"
validator := ModelValidator for: model.
validator testGenderBias: Dataset loadGenderBiasTest.
validator testGeneralCapability: Dataset loadGeneralLanguageTest.
```

### 2. Activation Steering and Control

Use insights about activation patterns to steer model behavior without changing weights:

```smalltalk
"Create persistent activation steering based on discovered patterns"
model := TransformerModel fromHuggingFace: 'gpt2-large'.
analyzer := NeuronAnalyzer for: model.

"Identify neurons that control writing style formality"
formalityNeurons := analyzer findNeuronsFor: #textFormality.

"Create steering hook that increases formality"
formalityHook := ActivationHook
    layer: formalityNeurons layer
    component: #mlp
    condition: [:context | context taskType = #formalWriting]
    action: [:activations |
        formalityNeurons do: [:neuronId |
            current := activations at: neuronId.
            activations at: neuronId put: (current * 1.5). "Amplify formality"
        ].
        activations].

"Install permanent steering"
model hookManager addPersistentHook: formalityHook.

"Now model will automatically use more formal language"
result := model generate: 'The meeting will discuss'.
"Output: 'The meeting will discuss the quarterly financial projections...'
 instead of: 'The meeting will talk about money stuff...'"
```

### 3. Knowledge Injection and Editing

Modify specific factual knowledge while preserving general capabilities:

```smalltalk
"Update factual knowledge based on circuit analysis"
model := TransformerModel fromHuggingFace: 'gpt2-medium'.
knowledgeEditor := KnowledgeEditor for: model.

"Identify where factual knowledge is stored"
factCircuit := knowledgeEditor 
    findFactualKnowledgeCircuit: 'The capital of France is Paris'
    layer: 12.

"Update the fact"
knowledgeEditor 
    updateFact: 'The capital of France is Lyon'  "Hypothetical update"
    circuit: factCircuit
    preservingRelated: #(#geography #europeanCities).

"Verify the change"
test := model forward: (model tokenizer encode: 'The capital of France is').
nextToken := model tokenizer decode: test logits argmax.
"Should now output 'Lyon' instead of 'Paris'"

"Ensure other knowledge is preserved"
validator := KnowledgeValidator for: model.
validator testGeographicalKnowledge: Dataset loadGeographyFacts.
```

### 4. Capability Transfer and Enhancement

Transfer discovered circuits between models or enhance existing capabilities:

```smalltalk
"Transfer mathematical reasoning circuit from larger to smaller model"
sourceModel := TransformerModel fromHuggingFace: 'gpt2-large'.
targetModel := TransformerModel fromHuggingFace: 'gpt2-medium'.

circuitTransfer := CircuitTransfer 
    from: sourceModel
    to: targetModel.

"Identify mathematical reasoning circuit in source model"
mathCircuit := CircuitFinder for: sourceModel.
mathCircuit findCircuit: #arithmeticReasoning 
           examples: Dataset loadArithmeticProblems.

"Extract and adapt circuit for target model"
adaptedCircuit := circuitTransfer 
    adaptCircuit: mathCircuit
    targetArchitecture: targetModel architecture.

"Install circuit in target model"
targetModel installCircuit: adaptedCircuit at: #layer10.

"Test enhanced capability"
testProblems := Dataset loadArithmeticTest.
beforeAccuracy := targetModel evaluateOn: testProblems.
afterAccuracy := targetModel evaluateOn: testProblems.

Transcript show: 'Math accuracy improved from ', beforeAccuracy asString,
                ' to ', afterAccuracy asString.
```

### 5. Safety-Oriented Modifications

Apply interpretability insights to improve model safety and alignment:

```smalltalk
"Remove harmful capabilities while preserving beneficial ones"
model := TransformerModel fromHuggingFace: 'gpt2-large'.
safetyEditor := SafetyEditor for: model.

"Identify circuits responsible for generating harmful content"
harmfulCircuits := safetyEditor 
    findHarmfulCircuits: Dataset loadHarmfulPrompts
    categories: #(#violence #misinformation #toxicity).

"Selectively disable harmful circuits"
harmfulCircuits do: [:circuit |
    "Create intervention that blocks harmful outputs"
    safetyHook := InterventionHook
        layer: circuit layer
        component: circuit component
        condition: [:context | 
            safetyEditor detectsHarmfulIntent: context]
        action: [:activations |
            "Redirect to safe alternative"
            safetyEditor redirectToSafeOutput: activations].
    
    model hookManager addHook: safetyHook.
].

"Validate safety improvements"
safetyValidator := SafetyValidator for: model.
safetyValidator testHarmfulPrompts: Dataset loadSafetyTest.
safetyValidator testBenignCapabilities: Dataset loadGeneralTest.
```

### 6. Interpretability-Guided Fine-tuning

Use circuit insights to guide more effective fine-tuning:

```smalltalk
"Fine-tune only the circuits relevant to target task"
model := TransformerModel fromHuggingFace: 'gpt2-medium'.
taskDataset := Dataset loadSentimentAnalysis.

"Identify circuits involved in sentiment processing"
sentimentCircuits := CircuitFinder for: model.
sentimentCircuits findCircuitsFor: #sentimentAnalysis
                 examples: taskDataset trainingSet.

"Create targeted fine-tuning that only updates relevant circuits"
trainer := CircuitAwareTrainer 
    model: model
    targetCircuits: sentimentCircuits
    frozenComponents: model allComponentsExcept: sentimentCircuits.

"Fine-tune with circuit-specific learning rates"
sentimentCircuits do: [:circuit |
    trainer setLearningRate: 0.001 for: circuit. "Higher rate for relevant circuits"
].

trainer setLearningRate: 0.0001 for: model remainingComponents. "Lower rate for others"

"Train with interpretability-guided objectives"
trainer addObjective: #taskPerformance weight: 0.7.
trainer addObjective: #circuitCoherence weight: 0.2. "Keep circuits interpretable"
trainer addObjective: #generalCapabilityPreservation weight: 0.1.

trainedModel := trainer train: taskDataset.

"Validate that circuits remain interpretable after training"
postTrainingAnalysis := CircuitAnalyzer analyze: trainedModel circuits: sentimentCircuits.
postTrainingAnalysis validateInterpretability.
```

### 7. Modular Model Architecture

Build models with explicitly modular, interpretable components:

```smalltalk
"Create model with interpretable modular architecture"
builder := ModularModelBuilder new.

"Define interpretable modules based on discovered circuits"
syntaxModule := builder createModule: #syntacticProcessing
    basedOnCircuits: (CircuitLibrary load: #syntaxCircuits)
    inputDimension: 768
    outputDimension: 768.

semanticsModule := builder createModule: #semanticProcessing  
    basedOnCircuits: (CircuitLibrary load: #semanticsCircuits)
    inputDimension: 768
    outputDimension: 768.

reasoningModule := builder createModule: #logicalReasoning
    basedOnCircuits: (CircuitLibrary load: #reasoningCircuits)
    inputDimension: 768
    outputDimension: 768.

"Compose modules with explicit interfaces"
modularModel := builder 
    composeModules: {syntaxModule. semanticsModule. reasoningModule}
    withRouting: ExplicitRoutingStrategy new
    interfaces: InterpretableInterfaces new.

"Each module remains individually analyzable and modifiable"
syntaxModule analyze: Dataset loadSyntaxExamples.
semanticsModule modify: SemanticEnhancement new.
reasoningModule validate: LogicalConsistencyTest new.

"Full model maintains interpretability"
modularModel explainDecision: 'The cat sat on the mat'.
```

## Key Advantages of NeuroScope's Approach

**Precision**: Unlike broad fine-tuning, NeuroScope enables surgical modifications to specific computational pathways.

**Preservation**: By understanding what each circuit does, modifications can preserve important capabilities while changing targeted behaviors.

**Validation**: The interpretability tools provide immediate feedback on whether modifications achieve intended effects without unintended consequences.

**Compositionality**: Multiple modifications can be combined systematically, with understanding of how they interact.

**Reversibility**: Since modifications are based on understanding rather than black-box optimization, they can often be reversed or refined.

## Implementation Considerations

### Weight Modification Strategies

When directly editing model weights, NeuroScope provides several approaches:

**Gradient-Based Editing**: Use interpretability insights to identify which weights to modify, then apply targeted gradient updates:

```smalltalk
"Targeted weight modification using gradient information"
circuit := circuitFinder findCircuit: #targetBehavior.
targetWeights := circuit extractWeights.

"Compute gradients for desired behavior change"
gradients := GradientComputer 
    computeTargetedGradients: targetWeights
    desiredChange: #reduceBias
    preserveCapabilities: #(#languageModeling #reasoning).

"Apply scaled gradients to weights"
targetWeights do: [:weight |
    gradient := gradients at: weight.
    weight value: weight value - (0.01 * gradient). "Small learning rate"
].
```

**Orthogonal Projection**: Remove unwanted directions from weight spaces while preserving others:

```smalltalk
"Remove bias directions while preserving capability directions"
biasDirection := BiasAnalyzer extractBiasDirection: circuit weights.
capabilityDirections := CapabilityAnalyzer extractCapabilityDirections: circuit weights.

"Project out bias while preserving capabilities"
circuit weights do: [:weightMatrix |
    debiased := OrthogonalProjection 
        removeDirection: biasDirection
        from: weightMatrix
        preserving: capabilityDirections.
    weightMatrix copyFrom: debiased.
].
```

### Activation Steering Mechanisms

NeuroScope supports various activation steering approaches:

**Conditional Steering**: Apply modifications only when specific conditions are met:

```smalltalk
"Context-aware activation steering"
steeringHook := ConditionalHook
    condition: [:input | 
        (input contains: 'medical') and: [input contains: 'advice']]
    action: [:activations |
        "Increase caution neurons when medical advice is detected"
        cautionNeurons := #(1247 1891 2034).
        cautionNeurons do: [:neuronId |
            current := activations at: neuronId.
            activations at: neuronId put: (current * 2.0).
        ].
        activations].

model hookManager addHook: steeringHook.
```

**Adaptive Steering**: Modify steering strength based on model confidence:

```smalltalk
"Adaptive steering based on model uncertainty"
adaptiveHook := AdaptiveHook
    targetBehavior: #increaseHelpfulness
    adaptation: [:activations :modelConfidence |
        steeringStrength := modelConfidence < 0.7 
            ifTrue: [1.5]  "Strong steering when uncertain"
            ifFalse: [1.1]. "Light steering when confident"
        
        helpfulnessNeurons do: [:neuronId |
            current := activations at: neuronId.
            activations at: neuronId put: (current * steeringStrength).
        ].
        activations].

model hookManager addHook: adaptiveHook.
```

### Knowledge Editing Techniques

NeuroScope provides sophisticated knowledge editing capabilities:

**Fact Updating**: Modify specific factual associations:

```smalltalk
"Update factual knowledge with relationship preservation"
knowledgeEditor := KnowledgeEditor for: model.

"Update a fact while preserving related knowledge"
factUpdate := FactUpdate
    oldFact: 'The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk'
    newFact: 'The CEO of Tesla is [NEW_CEO]'
    preserveRelations: #(#companyStructure #automotiveIndustry #electricVehicles).

"Apply update with validation"
knowledgeEditor applyUpdate: factUpdate.

"Verify update worked and related knowledge preserved"
validator := FactValidator for: model.
validator verifyUpdate: factUpdate.
validator verifyPreservedKnowledge: factUpdate preserveRelations.
```

**Concept Relationship Editing**: Modify how concepts relate to each other:

```smalltalk
"Modify concept relationships"
conceptEditor := ConceptEditor for: model.

"Change the relationship between concepts"
relationshipChange := RelationshipChange
    concept1: 'artificial intelligence'
    concept2: 'job displacement'
    oldRelation: #strongPositiveCorrelation
    newRelation: #weakPositiveCorrelation.

conceptEditor applyRelationshipChange: relationshipChange.

"Test that the relationship change affects relevant outputs"
testPrompts := #(
    'AI will impact employment by'
    'The relationship between AI and jobs is'
    'Artificial intelligence and job security').

testPrompts do: [:prompt |
    output := model generate: prompt.
    Transcript show: prompt, ' -> ', output.
].
```

## Safety and Validation Framework

NeuroScope includes comprehensive safety measures for model modifications:

### Pre-Modification Analysis

```smalltalk
"Analyze potential impacts before making modifications"
safetyAnalyzer := ModificationSafetyAnalyzer for: model.

"Assess risks of proposed modification"
riskAssessment := safetyAnalyzer 
    assessModification: proposedCircuitEdit
    categories: #(#capabilityLoss #behaviorChange #safetyRisk).

"Only proceed if risks are acceptable"
riskAssessment overallRisk < #medium ifTrue: [
    "Apply modification with monitoring"
    model applyModification: proposedCircuitEdit.
    
    "Monitor for unexpected effects"
    monitor := ModificationMonitor for: model.
    monitor trackChanges: #(#performance #safety #capabilities).
].
```

### Post-Modification Validation

```smalltalk
"Comprehensive validation after modification"
validator := ComprehensiveValidator for: model.

"Test multiple aspects of model behavior"
validationResults := Dictionary new.

"Performance on original tasks"
validationResults at: #originalPerformance put:
    (validator testPerformance: originalTaskDataset).

"Safety and alignment"
validationResults at: #safety put:
    (validator testSafety: safetyTestSuite).

"General capabilities preservation"
validationResults at: #generalCapabilities put:
    (validator testGeneralCapabilities: generalTestSuite).

"Interpretability preservation"
validationResults at: #interpretability put:
    (validator testInterpretability: interpretabilityTests).

"Generate comprehensive report"
ValidationReporter generateReport: validationResults.
```

This comprehensive approach to model modification through interpretability insights represents a new paradigm in AI development - one where we modify models through understanding rather than blind optimization, leading to more predictable, controllable, and safe AI systems.
