# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update core documentation files with NeuroScope branding
  - Replace all instances of "SmalltalkLens" with "NeuroScope" in AGENT.md, mechanistic-interpretability-overview.md, and summary.md
  - Update all Smalltalk code examples to use NeuroScope class names
  - Ensure consistent project identity throughout all narrative text
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Update steering configuration files
  - Replace SmalltalkLens references with NeuroScope in all .kiro/steering/*.md files
  - Update class names, package names, and method references in technical guidance
  - Maintain consistency with new project branding in all steering rules
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 3. Update existing smalltalklens-documentation spec to neuroscope-documentation
  - Rename the spec directory from smalltalklens-documentation to neuroscope-documentation
  - Update requirements.md to reference NeuroScope framework instead of SmalltalkLens
  - Update design.md to describe NeuroScope architecture and components
  - Update tasks.md to reference NeuroScope classes and methods
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 4. Update all class name references in documentation
  - Replace "SmalltalkLens-Core" with "NeuroScope-Core" and similar package name patterns
  - Update class hierarchy examples to use NeuroScope naming conventions
  - Update test class references from SmalltalkLensTest to NeuroScopeTest patterns
  - Ensure all subclass definitions reference correct parent class names
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 5. Update method names and API references
  - Replace method names containing "SmalltalkLens" with "NeuroScope" equivalents
  - Update factory method calls like "SmalltalkLens loadDevelopmentTools" to "NeuroScope loadDevelopmentTools"
  - Update method comments to reference NeuroScope classes and concepts
  - Update error message references to use NeuroScope component names
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Update code examples and usage patterns
  - Replace all Smalltalk code examples in documentation to use NeuroScope classes
  - Update variable names and object instantiation examples
  - Update method call examples to use new class names
  - Ensure all code snippets maintain syntactic correctness with new names
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.1, 6.2_

- [x] 7. Validate and test all changes
  - Perform automated search to ensure no "SmalltalkLens" references remain
  - Validate that all Smalltalk code examples have correct syntax
  - Check that all cross-references between files are still valid
  - Verify that documentation maintains readability and consistency
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_
