# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves systematically changing the project name from "SmalltalkLens" to "NeuroScope" throughout the entire codebase, documentation, and configuration files. This includes updating class names, package names, method references, documentation, and any other occurrences of the old project name to maintain consistency and avoid confusion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with the framework, I want all class names to reflect the new "NeuroScope" branding, so that the codebase is consistent with the new project identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views any class name THEN it SHALL use "NeuroScope" instead of "SmalltalkLens" as the prefix
2. WHEN a developer views package names THEN they SHALL be updated from "SmalltalkLens-*" to "NeuroScope-*" format
3. WHEN a developer views class hierarchies THEN all references to SmalltalkLens classes SHALL be updated to NeuroScope equivalents
4. WHEN a developer views test classes THEN they SHALL be renamed from "SmalltalkLensTest" to "NeuroScopeTest" patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer reading documentation, I want all documentation files to use the new "NeuroScope" name consistently, so that there is no confusion about the project identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads any documentation file THEN it SHALL refer to "NeuroScope" instead of "SmalltalkLens"
2. WHEN a developer views code examples in documentation THEN they SHALL use NeuroScope class names and methods
3. WHEN a developer reads project descriptions THEN they SHALL describe NeuroScope's capabilities and features
4. WHEN a developer views README or overview files THEN they SHALL present NeuroScope as the project name

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the framework APIs, I want all method names and references to be updated to the new naming convention, so that the API is consistent with the new project identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls framework methods THEN any method names containing "SmalltalkLens" SHALL be updated to "NeuroScope"
2. WHEN a developer views method comments THEN they SHALL reference NeuroScope classes and concepts
3. WHEN a developer uses factory methods THEN they SHALL create NeuroScope objects with appropriate naming
4. WHEN a developer views error messages THEN they SHALL reference NeuroScope components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with configuration files, I want all configuration references to use the new project name, so that deployment and setup processes reflect the correct project identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views configuration files THEN they SHALL reference "NeuroScope" instead of "SmalltalkLens"
2. WHEN a developer views file paths or directory names THEN they SHALL use NeuroScope naming conventions where appropriate
3. WHEN a developer views metadata or project descriptors THEN they SHALL identify the project as NeuroScope
4. WHEN a developer views build or deployment scripts THEN they SHALL use NeuroScope naming

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with the existing spec files, I want the documentation spec to be updated to reflect the new project name, so that future documentation work uses the correct naming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views the existing smalltalklens-documentation spec THEN it SHALL be updated to reference NeuroScope
2. WHEN a developer reads spec requirements THEN they SHALL describe NeuroScope framework documentation needs
3. WHEN a developer views spec design documents THEN they SHALL describe NeuroScope architecture and components
4. WHEN a developer views spec task lists THEN they SHALL reference NeuroScope classes and methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining backward compatibility, I want the name change to preserve all existing functionality, so that the framework continues to work exactly as before with only naming differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs existing functionality THEN it SHALL work identically to before the name change
2. WHEN a developer uses the framework APIs THEN they SHALL provide the same capabilities with updated names
3. WHEN a developer runs tests THEN they SHALL pass with the new naming conventions
4. WHEN a developer loads models or performs analyses THEN the core functionality SHALL remain unchanged
