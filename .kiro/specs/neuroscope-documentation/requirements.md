# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating comprehensive class and method comments for the NeuroScope mechanistic interpretability framework. The documentation will provide clear, detailed descriptions of all classes and methods mentioned in the summary.md file, following Smalltalk documentation conventions and ensuring developers can understand the purpose, usage, and behavior of each component.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the NeuroScope framework, I want comprehensive class comments for all foundation classes, so that I can understand their purpose, responsibilities, and how they fit into the overall architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views any foundation class (TransformerModel, ActivationTensor, Hook) THEN the class SHALL have a detailed comment explaining its purpose, key responsibilities, and usage patterns
2. WHEN a developer views class comments THEN they SHALL include information about instance variables and their purposes
3. WHEN a developer views class comments THEN they SHALL include basic usage examples where appropriate
4. WHEN a developer views class comments THEN they SHALL follow Smalltalk documentation conventions with proper formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the layer hierarchy, I want detailed class comments for all layer types, so that I can understand the transformer architecture and how each layer contributes to the model's functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views TransformerLayer and its subclasses THEN each class SHALL have comments explaining their role in the transformer architecture
2. WHEN a developer views layer class comments THEN they SHALL explain the mathematical operations performed by each layer
3. WHEN a developer views layer class comments THEN they SHALL describe how layers interact with the hook system
4. WHEN a developer views AttentionLayer, MLPLayer, and EmbeddingLayer THEN each SHALL have specific implementation details in their comments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer implementing interpretability analyses, I want comprehensive method comments for all public methods, so that I can understand method parameters, return values, and expected behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views any public method THEN it SHALL have a comment describing its purpose and behavior
2. WHEN a developer views method comments THEN they SHALL include parameter descriptions and expected types
3. WHEN a developer views method comments THEN they SHALL include return value descriptions
4. WHEN a developer views method comments THEN they SHALL include usage examples for complex methods
5. WHEN a developer views method comments THEN they SHALL describe any side effects or state changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the hook system, I want detailed documentation for hook-related classes and methods, so that I can implement custom interventions and analyses effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views HookManager and Hook subclasses THEN they SHALL have comments explaining the hook lifecycle and execution model
2. WHEN a developer views hook methods THEN they SHALL include examples of common hook patterns
3. WHEN a developer views hook documentation THEN it SHALL explain how hooks integrate with the forward pass
4. WHEN a developer views hook documentation THEN it SHALL describe performance considerations and best practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer building analysis tools, I want comprehensive documentation for analysis and visualization classes, so that I can extend the framework with custom analysis capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views analysis classes (AttentionAnalyzer, NeuronAnalyzer, CircuitFinder) THEN they SHALL have detailed comments about their analytical capabilities
2. WHEN a developer views visualization classes THEN they SHALL have comments explaining rendering approaches and browser integration
3. WHEN a developer views analysis methods THEN they SHALL include information about computational complexity and memory requirements
4. WHEN a developer views analysis documentation THEN it SHALL include examples of typical analysis workflows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with browser integration, I want documentation for JavaScript interop and web-specific features, so that I can understand how the framework leverages browser capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views browser integration classes THEN they SHALL have comments explaining JavaScript interop patterns
2. WHEN a developer views WebGL and Canvas classes THEN they SHALL have comments about GPU acceleration and rendering techniques
3. WHEN a developer views browser storage classes THEN they SHALL have comments about data persistence and caching strategies
4. WHEN a developer views browser-specific methods THEN they SHALL include information about browser compatibility requirements
