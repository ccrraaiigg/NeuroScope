# Product Overview

NeuroScope is a mechanistic interpretability framework for transformer models, built in Smalltalk and designed to run in SqueakJS browsers. It provides an interactive, object-oriented approach to understanding how transformer neural networks work internally.

## Key Features

- **Zero-installation browser-based analysis** - Run complex interpretability experiments directly in web browsers
- **Interactive exploration** - Live introspection of model components with real-time visualization
- **Object-oriented design** - Everything (activations, hooks, interventions) is a first-class object
- **Circuit discovery** - Automated identification of computational pathways in transformers
- **Web-native graphics** - Leverage Canvas, WebGL, and SVG for rich visualizations

## Target Users

- ML researchers studying transformer interpretability
- Educators teaching neural network concepts
- Developers building interpretability tools
- Anyone wanting to understand how language models work internally

## Core Value Proposition

Combines the analytical power of existing interpretability frameworks with Smalltalk's unique strengths in interactive development, live object introspection, and browser-based deployment for maximum accessibility.
